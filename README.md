# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Title: Adoption of Microservices Architecture for E-commerce Platform
### Status: **Accepted**
### Date: **2024-12-13**

---

## **Context**

Our e-commerce platform requires scalability, flexibility, and maintainability to handle growing business demands. The application supports multiple functionalities, including user management, product catalog, shopping cart, order management, payments, and delivery tracking. The current monolithic architecture has limitations in scalability, development velocity, and fault isolation. These factors hinder our ability to innovate and respond to customer needs effectively.

---

## **Decision**

Adopt a **Microservices Architecture** for the e-commerce platform, breaking the monolithic application into distinct services based on business capabilities. Each microservice will be responsible for a single business domain and communicate through lightweight mechanisms such as RESTful APIs or gRPC.

Deploy these microservices in a **containerized environment managed by Kubernetes**, with cloud hosting to ensure scalability, availability, and high reliability.

## **Microservice Breakdown**

| Microservice       | Responsibilities                                                                 | Key Technologies/Tools                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **User Service**    | User registration, authentication, and profile management                      | Keycloak, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL          |
| **Catalog Service** | Product listing, search, filtering, and category management                    | Elasticsearch, Flask, MongoDB              |
| **Cart Service**    | Managing user shopping carts, including item addition, removal, and persistence | Node.js, Redis                             |
| **Order Service**   | Order placement, history, and status tracking                                  | Django, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL               |
| **Payment Service** | Processing payments, integrating with third-party payment gateways             | Python FastAPI, Stripe/PayPal APIs         |
| **Inventory Service**| Stock updates, warehouse synchronization                                      | Go, Cassandra                              |
| **Delivery Service**| Shipment tracking, delivery partner integration                                | Express.js, Kafka, MySQL                   |

## **Rationale**

### Development Decisions:

1. **Scalability**
   - Services can scale independently based on traffic and usage patterns (e.g., Catalog Service for high browsing traffic).

2. **Resilience**
   - Faults in one service (e.g., Payment Service) will not bring down the entire system.

3. **Flexibility in Development**
   - Teams can develop, deploy, and maintain services independently, enabling parallel workstreams.

4. **Technology Independence**
   - Each service can use the technology best suited for its requirements (e.g., Redis for caching in Cart Service, Elasticsearch for Catalog Service).

5. **Better Customer Experience**
   - Faster response times and reduced downtimes lead to a seamless user experience.

### DevOps Decisions:

1. **Observability**
   - Use Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for monitoring, logging, and visualization.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Implement pipelines for automated testing, integration, and deployment of services.

3. **Service Orchestration**
   - Use Kubernetes for managing and orchestrating containerized services.

4. **Security Practices**
   - Enforce authentication and authorization using OAuth2 with Keycloak.
   - Use secure communication (TLS) between services.

### Infrastructure Decisions:

1. **Containerization with Kubernetes**
   - Simplifies deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.
   - Provides service discovery, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

2. **Cloud Hosting**
   - Enables rapid scaling of resources during peak loads (e.g., Black Friday sales).
   - Provides reliability through managed services (e.g., managed databases, serverless options).

3. **Disaster Recovery**
   - Set up cloud-based disaster recovery solutions with frequent backups and multi-region support.

## **Impact**

### **Advantages**
- Improved scalability and fault tolerance.
- Faster time to market for new features.
- Easier codebase management for teams.
- Reliable infrastructure with automated scaling and recovery.

### **Challenges**
- Increased operational complexity (e.g., service orchestration and monitoring).
- Need for robust API management and security mechanisms.
- Higher resource overhead compared to monoliths.

---

## **Implementation Plan**

### Development Implementation:

1. **Initial Phase:**
   - Break down the monolithic application into User Service, Catalog Service, and Cart Service.
   - Set up API Gateway for routing and authentication.

2. **Integration Phase:**
   - Introduce messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous communication.
   - Connect with third-party services (e.g., payment gateways).

### DevOps Implementation:

1. **Testing and Monitoring:**
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines for each service.
   - Set up observability using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

2. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy in a Kubernetes cluster with Helm charts for each microservice.

### Infrastructure Implementation:

1. **Scaling and Load Balancing:**
   - Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) for scaling services.
   - Leverage cloud-based load balancers (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancing).

2. **High Availability:**
   - Deploy services across multiple availability zones in the cloud.

3. **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Automate backups of critical databases and services.

---

## **Technical Decisions**

- **Service Communication:** Use RESTful APIs for synchronous calls and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging.
- **Database Strategy:** Polyglot persistence, where each service manages its own database.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Centralized authentication using OAuth2 (Keycloak) with token-based authorization.
